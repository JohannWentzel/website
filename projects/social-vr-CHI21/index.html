                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p>How do you design a physically-accurate social VR space for multiple users when one has a small office and the other has a gymnasium? We discuss the trade-offs and challenges for designing physically-accurate VR spaces for multiple users via the physical-virtual spectrum, and discuss possible approaches for resolving the conflicts between VR users' varying physical environments. We provide initial discussion and directions for future research.</p>

                    and the resolution of these spaces to each other. Consider the spectrum above, on the far left of the spectrum
                    is a virtual reality and on the far right is a virtualized reality [2]. Moving along the spectrum requires different
                    resolution strategies: a) two users (blue and green arrows below) are in their own reality and meet in a virtual
                    reality (above) where the system resolves their orientations; b) two users are in their own reality (below)
                    but their couches are in a partial virtualized reality that the system resolves by rotating and merging them
                    together (above); and c) two users are in their own virtualized reality (below) and meet up in a shared virtual
                    reality space where the system resolves their spaces to maximize shared presence (above). The yellow square
                    is the greatest common space between the users [4].</small>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <!-- <img class="figure img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/technique.png"> -->
              
                <p>Virtual reality (VR) allows people to spend time together and feel socially present with others
                regardless of the distance between them. As consumer-accessible VR devices re-energize public
                interest in VR, and the COVID-19 pandemic pushes social VR applications like Rec Room and
                VRChat to significant user activity milestones [3, 7], the design of social VR spaces becomes all
                the more crucial to the technology’s mainstream appeal. An under-considered factor in the design
                of social VR is how the user’s physical space can be used to aid their sense of presence in around
                the people they meet in VR. Converting the user’s physical space into a digital copy of itself,
                a virtualized reality [2], has been used in the past to allow for navigation, blending, and timemanipulation [1, 5]. However, there has been little research into how these virtualized realities can
                be mapped when multiple users share the same virtual space or how this can be used to enhance
                their shared sense of presence and belonging.</p>
                <p>As an example, imagine three users want to watch a movie in VR, sitting together in a VR theatre.
                All three users are in different physical spaces with different physical seating arrangements, and as
                such the VR theatre application must reconcile these differences in seating to create the illusion of the
                users sitting "together" (Figure 1b). How should the application best prioritize (a) minimizing friction
                by tailoring the environment to the user’s physical space; (b) maintaining this physical-virtual
                connection for multiple users; and (c) achieving this balance with minimal manual intervention?
                This paper presents a simple design space to examine applications’ considerations for their users’
                physical environments, and an initial discussion of ways to resolve these physical-virtual space
                conflicts for multiple users.</p>

            <div id="conflicts" class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-xs-12 offset-xs-0 content-section">
                <h1>Physical-Virtual Conformity and Conflicts</h1>
                <p>We discuss two elements of multi-user spatially-accurate environments and represent them in a
                    concise uni-dimensional <b>physical-virtual spectrum</b> (Figure 1). The poles of the spectrum represent
                    two opposing environments. On the left of the spectrum is a virtual reality. This can represent any
                    kind of virtual environment where users meet in VR, like VRChat [3], and has no basis in physical
                    reality. The right side of the spectrum is a complete virtualized reality [2]. This is a copy of the
                    user’s physical world represented in a virtual reality environment. The canonical representation of
                    this would be a virtual environment that is one-to-one with reality and is indistinguishable. The
                    space between these two poles represents partial representations of these realties merged together,so we can have a virtualized table merged with a virtual environment. This can be thought of as an
                    inversion of the Reality-Virtuality Continuum [6].</p>

                    <p>From the perspective of the system, conflicts can occur between either the virtual environment
                    and a single virtualized environment, or between each of the users’ virtualized environment in their
                    shared space. So, for each point on this spectrum, different resolution strategies need to be adopted
                    to resolve conflicts during merging in order to create a shared sense of presence and belonging.</p>

                <h1>Resolving Physical-Virtual Conflicts</h1>
                <p>Resolving conflicts within multiple varying user spaces is an open VR design challenge. Our spectrum highlights the difficulty in creating environments that match each user’s physical environment
                    while maintaining each user’s connection to their individual physical space. To address this, we
                    propose three separate resolution strategies that could be employed by future designers and researchers. 
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Orientation-centric</b> resolution matches each user’s physical direction in the room,
                            establishing a common "forward" direction in the space (e.g. toward a shared common screen,
                            Figure 1a).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Object-centric</b> resolution involves designating a common object or geometric
                    feature as a coordinate-space anchor, like the couches in the "VR theatre" example (see Figure 1b).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Geometry-centric</b> resolution involves culling outlying geometry to establish a "greatest
                            common space" between users’ physical areas (see Figure 1c).</li>
                        </ol>

            </div>

            <div id="conclusion" class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-xs-12 offset-xs-0 content-section">
                <h1>Conclusion and Future Work</h1>
                <p>Reducing the friction between users’ real and virtual spaces will allow mixed-reality social activities
                    to become much more comfortable and engaging. Our physical-virtual spectrum provides an initial
                    discussion of the topic, and future work will involve a series of usability experiments to determine
                    the areas of this spectrum that provide the most value for social environments in VR.</p>
