                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p>People with limited mobility often use multiple devices when interacting with computing systems, but little is known about the impact these multi-modal configurations have on daily computing use. A deeper understanding of the practices, preferences, obstacles, and workarounds associated with accessible multi-modal input can uncover opportunities to create more accessible computer applications and hardware. We explored how people with limited mobility use multi-modality through a three-part investigation grounded in the context of video games. First, we surveyed 43 people to learn about their preferred devices and configurations. Next, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 participants to understand their experiences and challenges with using, configuring, and discovering input setups. Lastly, we performed a systematic review of 74 YouTube videos to illustrate and categorize input setups and adaptations in-situ. We conclude with a discussion on how our findings can inform future accessibility research for current and emerging computing technologies.</p>

                <h1>Methodology</h1>
                <p>
                    To fully explore how people with mobility limitations use multi-modal input for accessibility, we performed a three-part investigation:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A <b>survey</b> of 43 people with mobility limitations to see the number of devices and combinations being used in everyday setups.</li>
                    <li><b>Semi-structured interviews</b> of 14 people with mobility limitations to gain deeper insight into these combinations and associated challenges.</li>
                    <li>A <b>systematic review of YouTube</b>, analyzing 74 videos of people using accessible multi-modal input setups.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <div id="Survey" class="col-md-10 offset-md-1 col-xs-12 offset-xs-0 content-section">
                <h1>Survey</h1>
                <!-- <img class="figure img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/technique.png"> -->
                <p>We surveyed 43 people with mobility limitations to look at their <b>preferred devices and input configurations</b>.</p>

                <p>
                    First, we asked respondents which <b>categories of computing device they own</b>.
                </p>
                <img class="figure col-lg-6 offset-lg-3 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/survey-devices.png">

                <p>
                    Next, we asked respondents to list all the <b>input devices they use with these computing devices</b>.
                </p>

                <img class="figure col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/survey-inputs.jpg">

                <p>
                    We organized these input devices into four categories:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Discrete</b>, which has a distinct "on" and "off" state, like a button.</li>
                        <li><b>Continuous</b>, where the input value can be anywhere within a specific range, like a joystick or mouse.</li>
                        <li><b>Controller</b>, which combines both discrete (buttons, d-pads) and continuous (joystick) input styles. Game controllers fit into this category.</li>
                        <li><b>Voice</b>, which doesn't really fall into any of the above categories but is still important to consider.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Continuous devices seem to encounter the most use, with discrete making up a significantly smaller fraciton. Interestingly enough, devices <i>specifically for accessibility</i> only begin to appear starting at the 8th most common position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Following this, we asked respondents to list all the combinations of devices they use, such as mouse-and-keyboard, trackpad and keyboard, etc.
                </p>

                <img class="figure col-12 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/survey-combos.jpg">

                <p>
                    Respondents said that they combined input devices frequently, but these input combinations <b>vary significantly</b> based on individual user ability. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    <u><b>Lesson learned</b></u>: there is no one-size-fits-all solution for creating accessible multi-device interfaces. Designing for <b>customization, inter-compatibility, and robustness to accommodate input variety</b> is of utmost importance to developers creating multi-modal input systems.
                </p>

                <h1>Experiment 1: Proof of Concept</h1>
                <p>We tested two amplification functions to make sure that they match the performance of the state-of-the-art, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3126594.3126605">Erg-O</a>.

                <p>We tested these functions with a two-target selection task in three task layouts: a small grid at the user's waist, a larger bubble around the user's reach, and a large grid making the user walk around.</p>

                <p>We found similar results to Erg-O, noting that in either case our technique provided better ergonomics with minimal effect on accuracy.</p>

                <p>We then tested our technique at a variety of different amplification strengths increasing gradually from <b>0%</b> to <b>50%</b> of the user's arm's reach.</p>
                <img class="figure col-xl-4 col-md-6 col-sm-8 col-xs-12 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/exp2-functions.png">
                
                <p>We tested these functions with a two-target selection task, with targets at three distances from the user's body: <b>close</b> (purple), <b>mid-range</b> (green), and <b>far</b> (blue). </p>
                <img class="figure col-xl-6 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/exp2-layouts.png">
                
                <p>We found that we can amplify user movements with this technique by up to <b>20%</b> of their arm length before reducing body ownership, <b>30%</b> before reducing accuracy, and <b>20%</b> before most users notice it.</p>
                <img class="figure col-xl-10 col-xs-12 img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="img/exp2-results.png">

                <p>Unexpected result! We found that users that played video games were more likely to notice amplificaiton happening. Many non-gamers
                <b>didn't notice amplification happening at all</b>. The below graph shows the amplification level and the percentage of participants who noticed:</p>
