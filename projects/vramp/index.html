                <h1>Abstract</h1>
                <p>Input amplification enables easier movement in virtual reality (VR) for users with mobility issues or in confined spaces. However, current techniques either do not focus on maintaining feelings of body ownership, or are not applicable to general VR tasks. We investigate a general purpose non-linear transfer function that keeps the user's reach within reasonable bounds to maintain body ownership. The technique amplifies smaller movements from a user-definable neutral point into the expected larger movements using a configurable Hermite curve. Two experiments evaluate the approach. The first establishes that the technique has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, increasing physical comfort while maintaining task performance and body ownership. The second explores the characteristics of the  technique over a wide range of amplification levels. Using the combined results, design and implementation recommendations are provided with potential applications to related VR transfer functions.</p>

                    <li>The user begins by defining a <b>neutral point (P<sub>N</sub>)</b>, and their <b>max reach (P<sub>max</sub>)</b>.</li>
                    <li>The system gets a <b> percent offset</b> based on the distance of the user's hand between their neutral point and their max reach. </li>
                    <li>That percent offset is plugged into an <b>amplification function</b> containing a <b>Hermite curve</b>, which returns an amplified hand offset, which is then applied to the virtual controller.</li>

                <h1>Experiment 1: Proof of Concept</h1>
                <p>We tested two amplification functions to make sure that they match the performance of the state-of-the-art, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3126594.3126605">Erg-O</a>. We call them <b>Low</b> and <b>High</b> respectively. Low has more subtle amplification while High is more aggressive. </p>

                <p>We tested these functions with a two-target selection task in three task layouts: a small grid at the user's waist, a larger bubble around the user's reach, and a large grid making the user walk around.</p>
